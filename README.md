### Hi there 👋

I have been a Web Developer 👩🏻‍💻 since 2010 (Full Stack/Frontend).

I am a speaker at different IT/tech conferences as well. In 2022 I became a Google Developer Expert. 🎉

In 2019 I founded [SkillUp Web School](https://skillup.lu/) in Luxembourg and [Cute Geek IT Agency](https://cute-geek.com/).

At SkillUp School, I help people without any IT background to be involved in our industry.

At Cute Geek IT Agency, we do different web projects for clients (React, 3D/Three.js, e-commerce, WordPress).

I am an organizer of JavaScript meetups and conferences. Currently, I am a co-organizer of the [LuxembourgJS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/luxembourgjs).

I like traveling, diving, animals, and playing video games 🎮. And I ❤️ my ginger cat 🐈
