### Hi there 👋

I have been a Web Developer 👩🏻‍💻 since 2010.

With my help, you can build an amazing website!

I am a speaker at different IT conferences as well. In 2022 I became a Google Developer Expert.

In 2019 I founded [SkillUp Web School](https://skillup.lu/) in Luxembourg and [Cute Geek IT Agency](https://cute-geek.com/).

At SkillUp School, I help people without any IT background to be involved in our industry.

I would like to inspire you to do some experiments with web technologies! 😺

💬 Ask me, maybe I can be your mentor 👩🏻‍🏫.

At Cute Geek IT Agency, we do different web projects for clients (React, 3D/Three.js, e-commerce, WordPress).

I like travelling, diving, animals, and playing video games 🎮. And I love my ginger cat ❤️

🌱 Currently, I am looking for a fully remote position in development or engineering management. [My CV](https://vasilika.ru/CV%20Vasilika%20Klimova.pdf)
